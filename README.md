How to run MusicSearch:
When the user runs the main, the program opens after a delay and a welcome window pops up. The user can choose whether to search a song, genre, artist, or album, by clicking on a button next to whatever category the user chooses. After choosing the category, the user can choose whether they want explicit songs to be included in their search, by clicking on the button next to explicit. Once the user enters another window will pop up and show the results of the search, which is sorted by song, artist, album, and genre, they can use the arrow keys to scroll up or down and side to side to read all the results on the page. The user can also compare the data structures complexity by the cout statements that happened when they search a category. The user can exit the the result screen and choose to search again or exit the program. 

Notes:
This code runs by using SFML, so it will not work unless the user has SFML version 2.5.1 installed.
